<h1 class="header-top">Impact of Fake News</h1>

<section class="header-body">

  <p>
Governments around the world, particularly authoritarian ones, often deny unfavorable news or inconvenient information, calling it fake news or false rumor, and yet what was denied often turns out to be true eventually. For instance, when Dr. Li Wenliang warned of a SARS-like disease in the early stage of the Covid-19 coronavirus outbreak, he, along with several other doctors in China, was reprimanded by the authorities for rumor-mongering (New York Times, 2020). A few months later, amid the global pandemic, he was officially recognized as a martyr (Su, 2020). For another example, in February 2012, when Wang Lijun, a top aide to a member of the Chinese Communist Party’s Political Bureau who was at the time contending for China’s top leadership position, defected to a US Consulate and was then taken away by China’s state security personnel, the municipal government where Mr. Wang held his position as a vice mayor denied intense internet discussions about his whereabouts and stated instead that Mr. Wang was simply undergoing a “vacation-style treatment” for health reasons (Branigan, 2012). The statement made “vacation-style treatment” an instant hit meme on the Chinese internet (Chin & Spegele, 2012)
</p>

<p>
  This phenomenon also exists in democracies. Former US President Donald Trump, for example, is well known for frequently branding unfavorable media reports as “fake news,” but those reports are often validated later (Farhi, 2019; Rogers, 2019). His popularization of the term, in fact, has led leaders around the world, including those from Hungary, Poland, Russia, Syria, and Venezuela, to follow suit and similarly attack inconvenient information and media scrutiny as fake news (Erlanger, 2017; Gabbatt, 2018).
</p>

<p>
  How will citizens react when a piece of “fake news” is demonstrated to be real? What are the consequences of false government denials on government credibility and citizen satisfaction with the government? A rapidly growing literature has examined the psychological foundations of belief in rumor, fake news, and misinformation1 (Flynn et al., 2017; Pennycook & Rand, 2019), their spread through the internet and social media (Grinberg et al., 2019; Guess et al., 2019; Vosoughi et al., 2018), their political and social impacts in various contexts (Fine & Ellis, 2010; Fine & Turner, 2001; Huang, 2017), and strategies for and effectiveness of correcting misinformation (Aird et al., 2018; Berinsky, 2017; Clayton et al., 2020). Very little work, however, has explored what will happen if an initial piece of “fake news” is later proven be real and the authorities’ denial turns out to be fake. We build on Huang’s (2017) analysis of the effects of rumors and rebuttals in an authoritarian setting to address these very questions about false denials.
</p>

<p>
  Although the issue of false government denials is perhaps relevant for all countries around the world, it is particularly important in authoritarian societies, since their relative lack of free news media and organizations that can provide independent information and fact-checking means not only that rumors and speculation are particularly prevalent (Kapferer, 1990; Sunstein & Vermeule, 2009), but also that the authorities are more tempted to use the “fake news” label to suppress discordant voices, criticism, or other inconvenient information. The ability to label claims and explanations that the authorities deem objectionable as fake has long been regarded as a power (Foucault, 1980; Levack, 2015). Because the revelation of the falsehood of government denials could erode the government’s power, it is important to investigate its consequences, particularly in the authoritarian setting.
</p>

<p>
  We address these issues using an online survey experiment (wave 1) and a follow-up survey (wave 2) in China. Both waves used online rumors that were initially denied by local governments but later turned out to be true. Unlike much of the existing literature that focuses on the short-term effects of (mis)information and corrections on public opinion and political attitudes, our study was designed to examine not only the immediate effects of government denials, but also whether the revelation about the falsehood of government denials has lasting effects on how the public views the authorities.
</p>

<p>
  Specifically, in the survey experiment, one group of respondents was exposed to a rumor about the government’s new automobile registration policy, an issue of common interest due to prevalent traffic congestion in Chinese urban areas. The second group was exposed to the same rumor and then the government’s denial of the rumor. The third group was exposed to the rumor, the government’s denial, and then a news event in which the initially denied rumor was verified to be true. In the follow-up survey, which occurred about 3 weeks after the initial survey experiment, respondents in the third group of the first wave (those who received verification of the initial rumor) were re-enrolled to observe another rumor and the government’s denial. For comparison, a brand-new group of respondents was also recruited in the second wave and exposed to the same rumor and denial as the re-enrolled respondents from the first wave.
</p>

<p>
We find that citizens can be persuaded by the authorities’ labeling of a piece of news as fake and decrease their belief in the news, which suggests why governments like to use the label of fake news. But when the government’s denial is revealed to be false and the original news was proven to be real, citizens will not only decrease their belief in the current government denial, but also decrease their belief in a similar government denial in the future. Moreover, such an experience with the government’s lack of credibility will negatively affect people’s general satisfaction with the government in the relevant issue area. In other words, government denials that are revealed to be false will not only have an immediate effect on public opinion, but citizens’ awareness of the government’s lack of credibility can persist and continue to shape their views on the government in the future. Matching and sensitivity analysis show that these results are robust with regards to functional form assumptions and potential unobserved confounders. Thus, the authorities’ branding of news as fake may erode the public’s long-term political trust and satisfaction with the government, once the falsehood of the denials is revealed.

<h1 class="steps">
When companies are vulnerable to false information</h1>
<p>Fake news is not just a political problem, though. Sarah Wiggins, a corporate partner with Linklaters London, says companies can be especially vulnerable to false information, particularly in connection with M&A activity or litigation, because of the speed with which it can spread. This can be up to six times faster than ‘normal’ news, propelled by instant messaging and in particular dissemination not by individuals but networks of bots, which typically account for 25% of total traffic.</p>

<h1 class="steps">Open-source journalism to fill the investigative void</h1>
<p>
  But some pillars of truthful news have crumbled, perhaps forever. The traditional media outlets that would be willing to spend weeks and months in pursuit of a complex but important story have seen their resources sapped by the shift of advertising online. At the same time that science-based investigation has become the target of political attacks, deep expertise has become a luxury that many publications feel they can no longer afford.
</p>
<p>
  However, to some degree the void is being filled by new types of journalism. Aliaume Leroy, an open-source investigative journalist with BBC Africa Eye as well as a member of the Bellingcat investigation team, says digital tools and online sources are providing journalists with the ability to uncover the truth and contradict fake news – even if their painstaking methods echo the methodical approach of the “shoe-leather” reporters of times past.
</p>

<p>
  Last year Mr Leroy and his colleagues uncovered the perpetrators of the execution of two women and two children in West Africa, after a video was circulated on social media. Using elements of the video images, such as the surrounding landscape, the shadows cast by the perpetrators and the equipment they carried, the investigators were able to contradict assertions by the Cameroon government that its soldiers were not responsible.
</p>

<p>
  They placed the scene of the killings just inside the country’s border, narrowed the date of the incident to three weeks in March-April 2015, and identified the individuals involved by comparison with social media images, leading to their subsequent arrest. Says Mr Leroy: “We could have just listened to what the government said and thought, we don’t have time to investigate this. But with a bit of time, curiosity, persistence, and a critical eye to keep questioning yourself, it is a first and very important step to debunk false information.” In Europe at least, the political authorities are alert to the dangers of fake news. Nicki Kayser, partner in charge of the capital markets and banking group at Linklaters Luxembourg, notes that Mariya Gabriel, the European commissioner for the digital economy and society, has warned that the entire democratic process could be in jeopardy.
</p>

<p>
  The Commission has put forward an action plan to improve the detection, analysis and exposure of disinformation, involving both human and automated fact-checkers, and launched a code of practice signed by internet giants Facebook, Google, Twitter and Mozilla. However, a key focus is education of the population to raise our awareness of fake news and improve resilience in society by boosting understanding and raising awareness of tools used to deal with it
</p>

<p>
  Nicki Kayser, partner in charge of the capital markets and banking group at Linklaters Luxembourg is hopeful that greater understanding of the problem can lead to better solutions. He says: “Fake news is not new, it has been around for centuries, but the technical tools that exist today, coupled with increasing distrust of the mainstream media, have proved to be logarithmic multipliers of the potential of false information. Technical and content-based solutions may not enable us to control the phenomenon completely, but at least they can mitigate its impact on our societies.”
