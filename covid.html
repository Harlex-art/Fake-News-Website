    <h1 class="header-top">All COVID-19 Hoaxes & Myth Debunked</h1>
<section class="header-body">
  <p>
    There's a lot of information out there about coronavirus (COVID-19) and not all of it is true. How do you know if what you’re seeing online is fact or fiction?
  </p>
  <p>Here are common misconceptions about COVID-19.</p>

      <h1 class="steps">Is COVID-19 increasing the risk of stroke in infected patients? </h1>
        <p>A recent case study published in the New England Journal of Medicine suggests the possibility that COVID-19 causes blood clots in some individuals; however, other health systems have not seen an increase in strokes. Regardless of virus or no virus, early identification and treatment of stroke gives the best chance for a positive outcome. It is critical that patients seek help from EMS rather than arriving to the hospital on their own if they are experiencing any signs or symptoms of a stroke. This helps direct the patient to the most appropriate stroke center and allows that hospital to prepare for the most efficient response.</p>

      <h1 class="steps">At what point would it be more beneficial to test for immunity rather than focusing on screening the public for COVID-19?</h1>
      <p>One of the problems with testing for immunity is that we don’t currently have a reliable test available. Antibody testing tells us if someone has been exposed to proteins related to viruses, like COVID-19. These proteins cause our bodies to develop antibodies that are part of our immune response. There are several proteins associated with this new coronavirus that cause antibody production, but there are some similar proteins from other coronaviruses, too. At this time, we don’t know if the presence of these antibodies provides immunity to COVID-19.</p>

      <h1 class="steps">Should you really wipe down all your food from the grocery store before putting it away?</h1>
      <p>
        Currently, there are no reports of people contracting COVID-19 from food or packaging from grocery stores. You can wipe down packing and allow to air dry as a precaution, but it is not recommended that you wipe down non-packaged food you will ingest with chemical cleaners. To prevent the spread of infection, it’s best practice to regularly clean your kitchen, sanitize kitchen counters, and clean produce before eating.
      </p>

      <h1 class="steps">Can Vitamin and mineral supplements cure COVID-19?</h1>
      <p>
        Micronutrients, such as vitamins D and C and zinc, are critical for a well-functioning immune system and play a vital role in promoting health and nutritional well-being.  There is currently no guidance on the use of micronutrient supplements as a treatment of COVID-19.

      <p>WHO is coordinating efforts to develop and evaluate medicines to treat COVID-19.</p>
      </p>

      <h1 class="steps"> Does Hydrochloroquine have clinical benefits in treating COVID-19?</h1>
      <p>
        Hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, a treatment for malaria, lupus erythematosus, and rheumatoid arthritis, has been under study as a possible treatment for COVID-19. Current data shows that this drug does not reduce deaths among hospitalised COVID-19 patients, nor help people with moderate disease.* The use of hydoxychloroquine and chloroquine is accepted as generally safe for patients with malaria and autoimmune diseases, but its use where not indicated and without medical supervision can cause serious side effects and should be avoided.
      </p>

      <p>
        * More decisive research is needed to assess its value in patients with mild disease or as pre- or post-exposure prophylaxis in patients exposed to COVID-19.
      </p>

      <h1 class="steps"> Should People Wear Masks While Excercising?</h1>
      <p>People should NOT wear masks when exercising, as masks may reduce the ability to breathe comfortably. Sweat can make the mask become wet more quickly which makes it difficult to breathe and promotes the growth of microorganisms. The important preventive measure during exercise is to maintain physical distance of at least one meter from others.</p>

      <h1 class="steps">Does Water or Swimming Transmit the COVID-19 Virus?</h1>
      <p>The COVID-19 virus does not transmit through water while swimming. However, the virus spreads between people when someone has close contact with an infected person. </p>
      <h3>WHAT YOU CAN DO:</h3>
      <p>Avoid crowds and maintain at least a 1-metre distance from others, even when you are swimming or at swimming areas. Wear a mask when you’re not in the water and you can’t stay distant. Clean your hands frequently, cover a cough or sneeze with a tissue or bent elbow, and stay home if you’re unwell.</p>

      <h1 class="steps">The prolonged use of medical masks when properly worn, DOES NOT cause CO2 intoxication nor oxygen deficiency</h1>
      <p>The prolonged use of medical masks can be uncomfortable. However, it does not lead to CO2 intoxication nor oxygen deficiency. While wearing a medical mask, make sure it fits properly and that it is tight enough to allow you to breathe normally. Do not re-use a disposable mask and always change it as soon as it gets damp.</p>

      <h1 class="steps">Do people who get COVID-19 recover from it?</h1>
      <p>Most people who get COVID-19 have mild or moderate symptoms and can recover thanks to supportive care. If you have a cough, fever and difficulty breathing seek medical care early - call your health facility by telephone first. If you have fever and live in an area with malaria or dengue seek medical care immediately.</p>

      <h1 class="steps">Can Thermal scanners detect COVID-19?</h1>
      <p>Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have a fever (i.e. have a higher than normal body temperature). They cannot detect people who are infected with COVID-19. There are many causes of fever. Call your healthcare provider if you need assistance or seek immediate medical care if you have fever and live in an area with malaria or dengue</p>

      <h1 class="steps">Will drinking and gargling warm water every 15 minutes kill or flush out COVID-19 from my system?</h1>
      <p>No. While staying hydrated is very important, these practices do not prevent COVID-19. The best infection prevention methods for COVID-19 include wearing appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) at work, practicing social distancing, washing your hands, and having good hygiene. </p>

      <h1 class="steps">I've heard that COVID-19 can last on surfaces from 48 hours to 17 days. How long can it actually survive on surfaces?</h1>
      <p>
        It’s not certain how long the virus that causes COVID-19 survives on surfaces, but according to the World Health Organization, the virus seems to behave like other coronaviruses. Studies suggest that coronaviruses in general may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days. It also varies under different conditions (e.g. type of surface, temperature or humidity of the environment).
      </p>
      <p>
        Cleaning visibly dirty surfaces with simple disinfectants is a best practice measure to protect yourself and others from COVID-19 and other viral respiratory illnesses. After cleaning, wash your hands with soap and water, or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer or wash them with soap and water. Avoid touching your eyes, mouth, or nose.
      </p>

      <h1 class="steps">What is the risk of disease transmission from clothing exposed during work?</h1>
      <p id="bottom">
        While there have been no documented cases of transmission of COVID-19 via clothing and shoes at this point, following proper personal protective equipment guidelines at work and cleaning and disinfecting clothes properly is essential for preventing disease transmission.
